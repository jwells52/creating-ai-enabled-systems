## Research Paper
The research paper I conducted this system proposes that Few Shot Learning algorithms can be used for image classification of humpback whale idenities. Identification of humpback whales in images is difficult for traditional deep learning algorithms to be successful because there is a limited amount of data for each individual humpback whale. So, I researched on how Few Shot Learning can be utilized to conquer this problem.

## Systems Project
The systems project I built was an extension on the work I did for my Research Paper. It is essentially a web application that allows stakeholders to upload images and pass them through a Few Shot Learning model for automatic identification.
