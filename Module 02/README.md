# Module 2 - 6D Framework and Design Thinking

## Objectives
1. Apply the 6D framework to a problem
2. Explain the role of each dimension of the 6D framework towards a system design
3. Use design thinking techniques to decomposing an AI problem

## 6D Framework
The 6 dimensions of the 6D framework are defined in explicit detail [here](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2202/2202.03172.pdf). Below are the 6Ds with a brief summarization of each dimension:

**Decomposition** - Refine the technology concept, understand the technology use, and assess value. \
**Domain Expertise** - Collaboration with individuals with domain knowledge to understand business objects of a system. \
**Data** - The data engineering phase, what needs to be done for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline. \
**Design** - Understand which AI algorithms are applicable to the problem. \
**Diagnosis** - Address how the AI system is assessed and what metrics are used. \
**Deployment** - How will the AI system be employed when used in the real-world.

## Assignment

The goal of the assignment is to decompose a problem of your choice utilizing the [Concept Map Template](Concept_Map_Template.pptx).

The problem I chose for decomposition is *Computer Vision for Endangered Species Tracking*, you can access the concept map for this problem [here](Concept_Map_jwells52.pptx)
