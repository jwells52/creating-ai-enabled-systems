# Module 11 - Deployment Part 1

## Objectives
1. Select a deployment strategy based on the AI system that needs to be helped.
2. Develop a cost estimate for deploying a cloud system project.

## Assignment 10
The AI system that I am curating a deployment strategy is built off of the work that I've done for my research paper. Essentially the AI model for the system is an image classifier, and the system that it is employed into is a three component system. The components are a **Web Interface**, **Model Inference REST API**, and **Data Storage**, and for this assignment I will be deploying it in Microsoft Azure using their cloud services.

[Azure Cost Estimate excel file](./jwells52_azure_estimate.xlsx) is an excel file that breaks down the monthly cost for each component of the system. \
[Azure Component descriptions document](./jwells52_azure_component_descriptions.docx) is a word document that provides in-depth describes on the use-cases for each component of the system.
