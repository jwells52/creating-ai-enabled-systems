## Assignment 9
For this assignment, we were tasked to watch this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_X_7g63rY) and read this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00964.pdf). After reading, we need to document a use case scenario for each of the vendors CelebSET APIs that would result in minimal bias when in use. More specifically, how would we apply each of the models mentioned in the article that would cause the least harm to stakeholders.
