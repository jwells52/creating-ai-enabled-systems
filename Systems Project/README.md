# Systems Project

## Overview
This folder contains the code for running my System Project, for details on this system project please reference this [paper](./systems_project_paper.ipynb).

This system project is essentially just a web interface and REST API. Right now, the only way to run this project is locally, you will need to run both the front-end and back-end in order to have a fully functional system.

## Run the system project
A docker-compose.yml file was created so that the system can be ran with virtually one command. Execute the following command to run the system project locally.

`cd Systems\ Project/` \
`docker compose up`
