# Module 7 - Design Supervised Algorithms


## Objectives
1. Apply supervised algorithms to practical computer vision, time series, and natural language processing problems.
2. Utilize contemporary machine learning tools for designing, and implmenting supervised algorithms.

## Assignment 7
This module's assignment is to use RapidMiner Visual ML to prepare data and build models for classification and clustering tasks. It is **optional** because students are expected to focus more on their research paper that they are writing for the class.

I chose to not do this optional assignment as well because I am fully focused on writing my research paper.
